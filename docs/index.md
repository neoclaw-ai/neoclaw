# NeoClaw Documentation

Welcome to the NeoClaw docs. NeoClaw is a self-hosted AI assistant — a single Go binary that runs on your server and talks to you on Telegram.

## Getting started

If you're new, start here:

1. **[Quick Start](quick-start.md)** — Download, install, configure, and get your bot running in 5 minutes.
2. **[Telegram Setup](telegram-setup.md)** — Create a bot with BotFather and authorize your Telegram account.

## Going deeper

- **[Security](security.md)** — How NeoClaw keeps your server safe. Sandbox, command approvals, network filtering, and the three security modes.
- **[Memory](memory.md)** — How NeoClaw remembers things across conversations. Long-term memory, daily logs, and the SOUL.md personality file.
- **[Configuration](configuration.md)** — Every configuration option explained, with defaults and examples.
- **[Commands](commands.md)** — Quick reference for all slash commands (`/new`, `/usage`, `/jobs`, and more).
